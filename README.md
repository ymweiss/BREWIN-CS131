This repository contains my final submission for the quarter long project in UCLA's Fall 2022
offering of CS 131 (making an interpretor).
Included is interpreterv3.py which contains my work, intbase.py which contains
constants and functions provided in class, and the specifications for the project.
The specification for Project #3 (the final part) references the previous specifications,
so all of the specifications are included.
